# Quick Start

## Requirements

Basic requirements: You can install our emulator platform([simple-emulator](https://pypi.org/project/simple-emulator/)) and basic packages needed by the emulator using:   
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Other requirements: If you want to use a learning-based solution, you need to install some other packages. For example, you need to install [torch](https://pypi.org/project/torch/) to run [RL-demo-using-torch](https://github.com/AItransCompetition/Meet-Deadline-Requirements-Challenge/blob/master/solution_demos/rl_torch/solution.py).  
(*The packages supported on our submission evaluating system can be found in [import-package](https://github.com/AItransCompetition/Meet-Deadline-Requirements-Challenge/tree/master/solution_demos#import-package).)

## Run a Demo
After basic requirements installed, you can run run_this.py to evaluate the reno solution demo:
```bash
python3 run_this.py
```
Now you have successfully run the demo [Reno](https://github.com/AItransCompetition/Meet-Deadline-Requirements-Challenge/tree/master/solution_demos#reno), which can be used directly in the [submission](https://github.com/AItransCompetition/Meet-Deadline-Requirements-Challenge/tree/master/solution_demos#submit).   
If you want to change the evaluation process, you can modify run_this.py or create your own evaluating program. [Solution Evaluation](#solution-evaluation) will show you more details on how to achieve this.


# Your Task 

Participants need to implement a *Scheduler*. The *Scheduler* consists of two parts: *Blocks Scheduler* and *Bandwidth Estimator*.
We have provided some [demos of solution](https://github.com/AItransCompetition/Meet-Deadline-Requirements-Challenge/tree/master/solution_demos).

## Blocks Scheduler

*Blocks Scheduler* selects which block in `block_queue` should be sent at the time `cur_time`. You need to implement your scheduler algorithm in method `select_block`. 

The emulator will call `select_block` every time sender tries to select a block to send. Your algorithm needs to select a block and return its id.

**Input**: `select_block` will get `cur_time` and `block_queue`:  

- cur_time

  > The time when this method is called.

- block_queue

  > This parameter is a list object composed of currently sendable blocks. It is recommended to read about its detailed description: [block_queue](https://github.com/AItransCompetition/simple_emulator/tree/mmgc_stable#table--block_queue)

**Output**: Returns the index of the block to be sent. For example, returning `0` means the first block in `block_queue` will be sent.

## Bandwidth Estimator

*Bandwidth Estimator* updates the sending rate of sender. You need to implement your bandwidth estimator algorithm in method  `cc_trigger`.

The emulator will call `cc_trigger` every time packet acknowledged or packet dropped event happens. You can update the sending rate and states of your algorithm when `cc_trigger` is called.  

**Input**: `cc_trigger` will get `cur_time` and a two-tuple `event_info`:

- cur_time

  > The time when this method is called.

- event_info

  - event_type

    > There are three categories for the packet involved in the event: PACKET_TYPE_FINISHED, PACKET_TYPE_TEMP, PACKET_TYPE_DROP.
    >
    > PACKET_TYPE_FINISHED: The acknowledge packet that successfully reached the sender;
    >
    > PACKET_TYPE_TEMP: The packet that has not yet reached the sender;
    >
    > PACKET_TYPE_DROP: The packet that is used to inform the sender of packet loss.

  - packet_information_dict

    > A dictionary composed of the brief information of the packet. We recommend you to get more information at [packet_information_dict](https://github.com/AItransCompetition/simple_emulator#table--packet_information_dict).

**Output**: In addition to controlling by the estimated bandwidth, we also support solutions based on congestion window. The return of `cc_trigger` consists of `cwnd` and `send_rate`. E.g
```python
{
    "cwnd" : 10,
    "send_rate" : 10
}
```

## Other States Update Points

You can set or update the states of your algorithm in methods `__init__` and `on_packet_sent`. 
Moreover, you can also update the `send_rate` or `cwnd` when returning from `on_packet_sent`. Emulator calls `on_packet_sent` every time sender tries to send a packet.  

# Solution Evaluation

## Create an Emulator

```python
# Instantiate the solution
my_solution = solution.MySolution()

# Create emulator
emulator = Emulator(
    block_file=["datasets/application_traces/data_video.csv", "datasets/application_traces/data_audio.csv"],
    trace_file="datasets/network_traces/trace.txt",
    solution=my_solution,
    # The system will choose a number as the link buffer from the range MIN_QUEUE to MAX_QUEUE
    MIN_QUEUE=55,
    MAX_QUEUE=55,
    # enable logging packet. You can train faster if USE_CWND=False
    ENABLE_LOG=True
)
```

The `block_file`, `trace_file`, `solution` are necessary to construct an Emulator. And the function also provides some optional parameters to help diversified experiments. All the parameters and their descriptions are below:

| Parameters           | Default s | Description                                                     |
| :-----------------: | :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| **block_file** | \ | The list contains one or more application trace files |
| **trace_file** | \ | The network trace file which describe the bandwidth, loss rate, etc. |
| **solution** | \ | The object initialized for the algorithm to be tested |
| USE_CWND            | False   | Whether the algorithm is based on the congestion window |
| ENABLE_DEBUG        | False  | Output DEBUG information                       |
| MIN_QUEUE | 55 | The minimum link buffer size |
| MAX_QUEUE | 55 | The maximum link buffer size |
| ENABLE_LOG          | True   | Output packet-level LOG           |
| MAX_PACKET_LOG_ROWS | 4000   | The maximum number of records in a packet-level log file, if it exceeds the maximum number of records, a new file will be created |
| SEED                | -      | Emulator random seed                         |
| RUN_DIR             | -      | Emulator run root directory                |

## Run an Emulator

```python
emulator.run_for_dur(15)
```

The optional parameter indicates the cut-off time (in seconds) of the emulation. The default is infinite, that is, the emulation will not end until application trace ends.

## cal_qoe

```python
print("Qoe : %d" % (cal_qoe()) )
```

Calculate the QoE score based on the `output/block.log` in the running result.

# Analyzing Tools

In order to help participants better optimize the solution, we also provide some functional tools in the emulator.

```python
emulator.print_debug()

analyze_emulator(log_file="output/packet_log/packet-0.log", file_range="all")

plot_rate(log_file="output/packet_log/packet-0.log", trace_file="datasets/network_traces/trace.txt", file_range="all", sender=[1])
```

## print_debug

Show a brief analysis result, including delay, the number of packet lost, etc. The output example and corresponding explanations are as follows.

```
